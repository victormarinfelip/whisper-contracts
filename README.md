# whisper-contracts
sol contracts for whisper project. Whisper is a quick tool to send messages to any eth address in a structured way. Messages can be replied to, forming conversations, that can be retrieved sequentially havig the last message ID and working backwards. A front-end app will enable you to Whisper anyone.

Eventually RSA encryption will be added to the front-end app, so only the destination address can decrypt the message, and no plain readable text will be written to the blockchain.
