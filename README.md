sol contracts for whisper project. Whisper is a quick tool to send messages to any eth address in a structured way. Messages can be replied to, forming conversations, that can be retrieved sequentially havig the last message ID and working backwards. A front-end app will enable you to Whisper anyone.

Eventually RSA encryption will be added to the fron app, so only the destination address can decrypt the message, so no plain readable text will be written to the blockchain.
